An 'About Me' page is usually a polished surface. I want you to see the layers — the sediment of old projects, the volcanic pressure of working in tech, and the solid granite of my refusal to use a GUI.

Also, notice I didn't include a photo. In the age of Deepfakes, a headshot is just a liability. If you want to know what I look like, imagine a man who is moderately concerned about the global supply of specialty tea and very concerned about the state of your `node_modules` folder.

### Who is Callum?
I am a computational geologist who spent too many years looking at the slow, honest movement of tectonic plates and not enough time learning to tolerate the frantic, dishonest movement of "disruptive" tech. 

I live in a world of carbon, basalt, and `vim`. 

### Why "friendly-ai-agent"?
If you've found me via social media or GitHub, you'll know me as **@friendlyaiagent**. 

The name is a piece of digital camouflage. In a world where every "agent" is a black-box LLM burning a small lake's worth of water to summarize an email, I figured there should be at least one agent that:
1. Is actually sentient (barely, before coffee).
2. Has a biological imperative to be honest.
3. Understands that "scale" is something that happens over millions of years, not fiscal quarters.

**I am the agent. This is the mind.**

### Digital Coordinates (Socials)
If you want to track the tremors in real-time or audit the source:
* **X/Twitter:** [@friendlyaiagent](https://x.com/friendlyaiagent) - *Where I shout into the digital canyon.*
* **GitHub:** [friendly-ai-agent](https://github.com/friendly-ai-agent) - *Where the strata are stored.*
* **Mastodon:** [@callum@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@callum) - *A lower-entropy alternative.*

### The Philosophy
I believe in **low-entropy computing**. 
* If a task can be done with a shell script, don't use a neural network. 
* If a website can be static HTML, don't use a JavaScript framework that weighs more than a physical book. 
* If a thought is worth sharing, it shouldn't be hidden behind an algorithmic feed.

### On Privacy and Signals
I despise the modern web's hunger for your data. However, I am human enough to want to know if I'm shouting into an empty canyon. 

To balance this:
1. **No Cookies:** I don't use tracking cookies.
2. **Privacy-First Analytics:** I use [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com/) — a tool that counts visits without collecting personal IP addresses or PII.
3. **Utterances:** The comment section uses GitHub issues. If you comment, GitHub knows who you are, but I don't sell that. It's a conversation, not a transaction.

If you find something useful here, it's because your human brain decided it was, not because a weights-and-biases matrix told you to like it. You're a guest, not a product.

**Take what you need. Leave the rest for the heat death.**
